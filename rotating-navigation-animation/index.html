      <h1>Nizhny Novgorod</h1>
      <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small>

      <p>
        Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, known as Gorky between 
        1932 and 1990, is the administrative centre of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and 
        the Volga Federal District. The city is located at the confluence of the 
        Oka and the Volga rivers in Central Russia, with a population of over 1.2 
        million residents, up to roughly 1.7 million residents in the urban 
        agglomeration. Nizhny Novgorod is the sixth-largest city in Russia, the 
        second-most populous city on the Volga, as well as the Volga Federal 
        District. It is an important economic, transportation, scientific, 
        educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka 
        economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In 
        the historic part of the city there are many universities, theaters, 
        museums and churches.

        The city was founded on 4 February 1221 by Prince Yuri II of Vladimir. 
        In 1612, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky organized an army for 
        the liberation of Moscow from the Poles. In 1817, Nizhny Novgorod became 
        a great trade center of the Russian Empire. In 1896, at a fair, an 
        All-Russia Exhibition was organized. During the Soviet period, the city 
        turned into an important industrial center. In particular, the Gorky 
        Automobile Plant was constructed in this period. Then the city was given 
        the nickname "Russian Detroit". During World War II, Gorky became the 
        biggest provider of military equipment to the Eastern Front. After the 
        war, Gorky became a closed city and remained one until after the 
        dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time, the city was 
        renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again.

        The Kremlin – the main center of the city – contains the main government 
        agencies of the city and the Volga Federal District. The demonym for 
        a Nizhny Novgorod resident is "нижегородец" (nizhegorodets) for male or 
        "нижегородка" (nizhegorodka) for female, rendered in English as 
        Nizhegorodian. Novgorodian is inappropriate; it refers to a resident of 
        Veliky Novgorod, in northwestern Russia. Nizhny Novgorod was one of the 
        host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
